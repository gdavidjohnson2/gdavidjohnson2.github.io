                <p class="lead mb-5">Hi, I'm Grover Johnson. I am a Data Technician, Developer, and all around resource person. When people say, 'they know a guy'... chances are that I might be that guy. 
                    Over the last 20+ years I've worked in the telecommunications industry, supporting call centers that provide services to Fortune 500 companies, cancer research donations, political calls, and B2B sales; 
                    restored classic vehicles; designed and installed recycling systems; designed PLC and electrical control systems; hosted and designed web sites; performed weddings for quite a few couples and decorated a lot of cake.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">Developing code is like a form of magic. We take words and numbers, ordered in a certain way, to create actions and processes that function on their own. Words, numbers, and symbols that shorten our workflows, make complex and tedious tasks simple, 
                  and connect with devices across the globe look in every way like their own magic. One cannot argue the way our world is being reshaped and molded because of their use. As a developer, I am proud and awed to take part in this transformation on a dialy basis.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">In working IT and support roles over the years, I've tried not to conform to the typical stereotype of the impatient, rude, 'know-it-all' IT guy. It's important to be patient with people of different levels of technical expertise. 
                    I educate and train where able, giving helpful hints and workarounds for common problems that the users encounter. In trying to understand the problem, and not just rush on to the next, I've been able to cultivate a culture
                    of trust, respect, and an ability to rapidly get to the heart of the problem and fix it... which to many looks like magic.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">You can find my newest adventures on Github: <a href="https://github.com/gdavidjohnson2">gdavidjohnson2</a></p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">I think it's important to contantly improve ourselves though education, whether formally or informally. Always strive to be just a little bit better than yesterday. Please check back soon to see what trouble we might be able to get ourselves into next...</p>
